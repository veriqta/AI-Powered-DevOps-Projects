# AI-Powered DevOps Projects

Build production-minded systems that apply artificial intelligence to software delivery, cloud operations, platform engineering, site reliability, security, observability, infrastructure, and cost management.

This repository contains 100 hands-on projects based on problems engineers encounter in real environments. Each project goes beyond a short tool demonstration. You will design the system, write the code, provision the infrastructure, integrate delivery pipelines, secure the AI workflow, observe its behavior, test failure conditions, recover safely, and document the result.

The goal is not to add an AI chatbot to ordinary DevOps tasks. The goal is to learn where AI provides useful decision support, where deterministic engineering must remain in control, and how to build systems that can be trusted in production.

## Who this repository is for

These projects are designed for:

- DevOps engineers
- Site reliability engineers
- Platform engineers
- Cloud engineers
- Infrastructure engineers
- DevSecOps engineers
- Systems engineers
- Software engineers moving into cloud operations
- Students building practical AI and DevOps portfolios

You do not need to complete all 100 projects. Choose a learning path that matches your current role, experience, and career direction.

## What makes these projects different

Every project begins with a realistic engineering problem and leads to a complete, demonstrable result.

Depending on its scope, a project may include:

1. A realistic engineering problem and clearly defined users
2. A complete functioning system
3. Reproducible infrastructure as code
4. CI/CD integration
5. Security controls and documented trust boundaries
6. AI safety controls and structured output validation
7. Logs, metrics, traces, dashboards, and alerts
8. Controlled failure injection, recovery, and verification
9. Cost, latency, capacity, and performance analysis
10. Automated tests and measurable acceptance criteria
11. A production-readiness review
12. Interview questions and portfolio guidance

Not every project needs every component. The implementation must include every component required to solve the stated problem safely and credibly.

## Engineering principles

The repository follows several non-negotiable principles:

- Verified evidence and AI-generated conclusions must remain clearly separated.
- Model output must be treated as untrusted until it passes validation.
- Operational systems must continue safely when the model is unavailable.
- Destructive or high-impact actions must require explicit authorization.
- Agents and automation must use the minimum permissions required.
- Sensitive data must be removed or protected before it reaches an external model.
- Every automated action must produce an auditable record.
- Failure recovery must include verification, not only remediation.
- Cost, security, reliability, and maintainability are part of the design.

## Project levels

| Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Foundation | A focused project that teaches essential practices while producing a useful system. |
| Intermediate | A multi-component project with deployment, testing, security, and operational requirements. |
| Advanced | A production-oriented project involving distributed systems, governance, scale, or controlled automation. |
| Capstone | An end-to-end platform that combines multiple DevOps disciplines and requires defensible engineering decisions. |

## How to use this repository

1. Choose a project from the catalogue or select a recommended learning path.
2. Open the project folder and read its `README.md` before installing anything.
3. Complete the project-specific prerequisites and environment checks.
4. Use the starter project to build the system through the numbered labs.
5. Compare each milestone with the documented expected result.
6. Complete the failure exercises and verify recovery.
7. Run the automated tests and acceptance checks.
8. Review the reference implementation only after attempting the work.
9. Complete the production-readiness review.
10. Document the finished project in your own repository and prepare to explain your decisions.

## Standard project structure

Each published project follows a predictable structure so that you always know where to begin and what to do next.

```text

The numbered labs are the primary follow-along path. The walkthrough shows the completed execution from start to finish, including expected results. The reference implementation provides a working comparison, not a substitute for completing the labs.

## What a completed project should prove

A completed project repository should make it possible for another engineer to determine:

- What problem the system solves
- Who uses it and what decisions it supports
- How its components and data flows are designed
- How to create and remove the environment
- Which findings come from deterministic evidence
- Which findings or recommendations come from AI
- What information can reach the model
- Which actions the system is permitted to perform
- Which actions require human approval
- How the system behaves when the model is unavailable or wrong
- How permissions, policies, schemas, and outputs are validated
- How the system is monitored
- How normal behavior and failure conditions were tested
- What the system costs and how it behaves under load
- How recovery is performed and verified
- Whether the system is ready for production

## Build and document your own version

Participants are encouraged to create a separate repository for every completed project or maintain a clearly organized portfolio repository. Your work should show your decisions, implementation, tests, failures, corrections, and final results.

Do not present the reference implementation as your own work. Use it to check your understanding, investigate differences, and improve your implementation.

See [Submission Guidelines](docs/submission-guidelines.md) and [Portfolio Guidance](docs/portfolio-guidance.md) before publishing your work.

## Responsible AI use

These projects may process source code, build output, logs, infrastructure metadata, security findings, incident records, or other sensitive operational information.

Before connecting any external model:

- Use synthetic or explicitly authorized data.
- Remove credentials, tokens, personal information, and confidential values.
- Review the provider's data handling and retention settings.
- Apply input limits and request timeouts.
- Validate model output against an explicit schema.
- Test prompt-injection and unsafe-output scenarios.
- Keep a non-AI fallback for critical workflows.
- Never allow unrestricted model-generated commands to run against infrastructure.

Read [AI Safety Standards](docs/ai-safety-standards.md) and [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) before implementing model or agent integrations.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome when they improve technical accuracy, accessibility, safety, testing, or the learning experience.

Before opening a pull request:

1. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. Follow [PROJECT-STANDARDS.md](PROJECT-STANDARDS.md).
3. Keep examples reproducible and safe to run.
4. Include tests for code or behavioral changes.
5. Do not include secrets, private logs, customer data, or copyrighted course material.
6. Explain the problem, the proposed change, and how the result was verified.

## Project status

The repository is being developed progressively. Each project README will show its current status:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Planned | The project has been accepted into the catalogue. |
| In development | The guide, implementation, and tests are being built. |
| Review | The project is undergoing technical and learning-path review. |
| Ready | The project is available for complete follow-along use. |
| Maintenance | The project is ready and receives dependency, security, and documentation updates. |

## License

Review [LICENSE](LICENSE) before copying, adapting, redistributing, or using repository material commercially.

## Support and security

Use GitHub Issues for reproducible documentation errors, broken exercises, and technical defects. Do not report vulnerabilities or expose sensitive information in a public issue. Follow the private reporting process in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
